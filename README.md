## --Vehicle Rental Management System (C++ Mini Project)--

# --OVERVIEW--

The Vehicle Rental Management System is a console-based C++ application that automates vehicle rentals. It allows users to add vehicles (cars/bikes), view the full collection, and rent a vehicle based on availability. The system calculates rental cost by days and provides a simple payment option. Vehicle data is stored using file handling, so information persists between runs.
